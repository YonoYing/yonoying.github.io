Pin Detector
- Intro about getting into pinball and enjoying the scene 
- Motivation is wanting to learn about fast object detection & tracking
- Idea could be that people with more pinball knowledge than could use a tracking to tool to develop coaching programs 
- Used Yolo with a set of manually labelled video frames 

- Difficulties section
  - Labelling was time consuming 
  - Identifying ball in blurry frames was difficult
  - yolo struggled to track fast moving sections (bumpers)

- Further Plans 
  - Deelop synthetic dataset using Visual pinball (not working) and Unity percetion kit 
  - Train with a DeepSORT preprocessor to help track blurry frames

Azure AutoML 

- Working on energy sector demand displays at work 
- wondered about energy prediction, using publically available data 
- developed a jupyter book to extract and preprocess data for automl 
- fed data into auto ml to compare predicitons 
- prophet got outperfomed by: ?? 
- Show graphs 

BMO 

- Wanted to learn how 3d printing worked
- Hooked up to a rasbery pi and touchscreen 
- Developed an alg to scan the freq of the song and animate bmo's face in time 
- Touchscreen drivers were very difficult to manage 

Game Jams 

- Did two 
- enjoyed a lot 

Masters 

- Spiking NN explanation 
- TA explanation 
- Car Following experiment 
- Bounds verification 
    - Supercomputer constraints
