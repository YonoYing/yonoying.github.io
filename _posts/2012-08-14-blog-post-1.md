I really enjoy playing video games and I've always wanted to give game dev a shot. Two months back I freed up the time to enter a game jam finally and give development a shot myself. 

The game jam I entered was called Jame Gam and had the theme "Cheap Copy". I brainstormed all sorts of interpretations of this theme, but settled on simply making a cheap copy of an existing arcade game in order to keep the test for myself simple and avoid scope creep. The game I made took about 5 days to finish, and is a 'cheap copy' of the arcade game Q*bert. It can be played on my itch page [here](https://yonoying.itch.io/roof-juice), and a screen shot of it is shown below.

The jam also specified a 'special item' to try work into the gameplay somehow, for this jam it was an umbrella. I decided to give the player an umbrella they could use to ride back to the top of the pyramid mary-poppins style, in place of the rainbow disks used in Q'bert. There are also rain clouds that fly by to reset tiles in later levels, that player can block using the umbrella. I really enjoyed the jam and I feel like I learnt a lot about Unity and gameplay development in general. In particular I felt it was really useful to parameterize as many aspects of gameplay as possible (umbrella cooldown, cloud frequency, etc), so they could be finetuned in a testing phase at the end of development.
