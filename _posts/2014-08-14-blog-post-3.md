I work in a office full of industrial designers and I'd love to learn how to 3d print, and how translating dimensions from/to digital space works. Its also been a while since I did any electronics development (I've been doing mostly Qt frontends in C++ for the last year or so), so I'd love to make something involving that too. I decided it would be fun to try make a bluetooth speaker in the form of the character BMO from the show Adventure Time. BMO is a fan favourite and a really cool character, and the idea of making them IRL sounded realy fun. 

I got a friend from the ID team to help me put together the model in blender (I dont know how to use CAD and I wanted this done before halloween). I put together the electronics using a left over arduino and speaker I found at the office, and a battery pack and touch screen I ordered online. The electronics can be seen in the image below. The printing result came out really well I think! The touchscreen was a bit much for the arduino, it was quite difficult to set up and slows it down a lot. If I had more time I would have made a bluetooth app to control the visuals from my phone, and swapped it out for a dumb screen. But all up I enjoyed the project, and I'm glad to have BMO chilling on my bookshelf :)
